            My name is Alex, and I'm a 2nd year at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and Economics.
            I am currently assisting Professor Junchen Jiang in the UChicago CS Department with research on source-driven video streaming optimization with ROI-encoding.
            Outside of classes, I also enjoy running and editing videos.

            My idea is an app that scans book covers and automatically generates citations for you. 
            Currently there are website where you have to manually input all of the relevant information,
            so this app would be a convenient and easy to use alternative.
