            This past spring I took a course on Software Development
            where I gained valuable experience in breaking down large software projects
            into manageable tasks. The class-wide project continued work on a custom game
            engine that was started the previous year, with my team focusing on a new
            battle system that would allow the player to fight enemies.

            <br><br>

            Along with practicing workflow techniques such as issue tracking, code reviews,
            and continuous integration, I also learned team management skills and how
            collaboration boosted our team’s productivity. From my past experience in
            game programming, I could think about games at a higher level, and I found that
            I gravitated toward a role of overseeing how all of our team’s pieces would come
            together and fit within the existing code architecture. Coordinating meetings
            with other teams and ensuring that our team had a clear design plan at all times
            prepared me for work on future projects.

            <br><br>

            I contributed around 2,000 lines of code. These files can be located primarily within the src/battle and tests/battle folders. I also created several Github Issues and Pull Requests<br><br>
