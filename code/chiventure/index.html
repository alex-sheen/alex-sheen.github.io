                  In Spring quarter of my Freshmen year, I took a course called Introduction to Software Development
                  where I gained valuable experience in breaking down large software projects
                  into manageable tasks. The class-wide project continued work on a custom game
                  engine that was started the previous year, with my team focusing on a new
                  battle system that would allow the player to fight enemies.
      
                  <br><br>
      
                  Along with practicing workflow techniques such as issue tracking, code reviews,
                  and continuous integration, I also learned team management skills and how
                  collaboration boosted our team’s productivity. From my past experience in
                  game programming, I could think about games at a higher level, and I found that
                  I gravitated toward a role of overseeing how all of our team’s pieces would come
                  together and fit within the existing code architecture. Coordinating meetings
                  with other teams and ensuring that our team had a clear design plan at all times
                  prepared me for work on future projects.
      
                  <br><br>
      
                  I contributed around 2,000 lines of code. These files can be located primarily within the src/battle and tests/battle folders. I also created several Github Issues and Pull Requests.<br><br>
