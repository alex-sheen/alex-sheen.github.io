              For this project, <span class="beige_text">partnered with an MFA graduate student to translate their physical sculptures into an interactive Augmented Reality experience</span>.
              Their work frequently features hinged frames of differing dimensions and explores how their movement can reveal 
              new interactions between the sculpture and the space it occupies. Our AR piece extends this notion with the common idea in 
              AR of <span class="beige_text">"a world inside a world"</span>.
              <br><br>
              
              I used OpenEndedGroup's Field to place virtual objects in the viewer's live camera feed of the real-world environment, allowing the viewer to 
              physically walk around the virtual sculpture. <span class="beige_text">Our piece utilizes the OpenGL Stencil Buffer to 
              only draw the light gray sculptures when they are viewed <i>through</i> a black frame</span>. Each frame is paired with a 
              single gray object, but overlapping frames will reveal all of their respective objects. By utilizing the Stencil 
              Buffer in this way, we create a metaphysical world within the frames in this AR space.
              <br><br>

              A non-AR test is shown below. You can see how the red and green cubes only appear when viewed through certain frames.
              Some frames reveal just red cubes, some just green, and others both. At the end, the camera looks behind the frames
              to find that the cubes don't exist outside of the world as seen through the frames.
