                    Is it possible to escape the shadow of the past in Greece today? <br>
                    <br>
                    The reality is that the Greek state has already erased certain aspects of its own past 
                    to create a homogenous and unifying memory that dominates public perception of Greece, both locally and abroad. Whether
                    it is through the removal of non-Classical structures on the Athenian Acropolis or the forced renaming of towns from Slavic to Greek names, 
                    Greece's attempts to escape the shadow of its past have largely demonstrated success in shaping perceptions by the 
                    average individual. This work walks through a photogrammetric reconstruction of the Ancient Athenian Agora and the adjacent
                    Adrianou street, a site where historical and modern strata meet in tension. By shifting and dissolving these strata, the work
                    visualizes the steps the modern Greek State has taken to curate its historical narratives and exposes the voices and 
                    cultural vibrancies that will be overwritten by a continuation of such efforts.

            Sanitization of Greek History
              <div class="projtext" style = "width:100%">
                  In its efforts to root its nation's foundations in the Classical period, the Greek state has metaphorically and physically destroyed
                  aspects from its past to create a sanitized version that permeates popular culture both locally and internationally. The modern
                  presentation of the Athenian Acropolis, for example, has stripped the site of any non-Classical or non-structural elements. Lacking the
                  metal adornments, free-standing statues, polychomatic colors, and post-Classical buildings that should be visible, the current Acropolis
                  is a barren, white-washed, curated image that has become the embodiment of Greece as a whole, one that attracts millions of 
                  tourists each year. The sanitization of the Acropolis is therefore a testament to the success Greece has had in escaping the 
                  shadow of their past, at least in the eyes of international popular culture. As a result, however, these efforts often
                  erase cultural vibrancies.
                  <br><br>

                  In recent years, there has been increased pushback against the destructive tendencies that arise from such historical sanitization.
                  In 2019, the Greek courts blocked the demolition of two Art Deco era buildings on Dionysiou Areopagitou Street in Athens. These
                  buildings were scheduled to be removed to clear a view from the New Acropolis Museum up to the Acropolis itself, a demolition that would
                  have aligned with Greek's history of sanitization efforts. On other cases, such as the approved demolition of buildings on the corner
                  of Makrygiannis 10 and Hatzichristou 21, these sanitizations are fulfilled. Although the existence of these conflicts reveal internal conflict regarding this
                  issue, they do not contradict the fact that Greece's sanitization efforts have proved successful when decisions are unanimous, 
                  demonstrating that it is indeed possible to escape the shadow of the past in Greece when it is desired.
                  <br><br>

                  If decisions were unanimous and such sanitization efforts continue, what will happen to the excavataions at the Ancient Athenian 
                  Agora? Presently, excavations are halted as the archaeolical site extends below the modern street of Adrianou. This work visualizes
                  what possibilities might arise should the opinion of the Greek courts shift, demolishing the modern building facades in an 
                  explosion of points that reveal the potential archaeological remains that lie below.

                    281 images of the Ancient Athenian Agora were processed with photogrammetric software AliceVision Meshroom to

                    Meshroom ran on UChicago's Peanut Cluster using 281 photos taken from the Ancient Agora in Athens, Greece. Non-research jobs are capped at 4 hrs
                    on the Peanut Cluster, so the photo set had to be broken into two, one for the Ancient Agora and one
                    for the modern street, Adrianou.
                    <br><br>
                    The photo set included many sub-optimal photos that included tourists who changed positions across different images. To improve output, the Meshroom 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/issues/683#issuecomment-545801680">--overrides</a> parameter was used to set the 
                    <a href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki/Reconstruction-parameters">parameters</a> for <i>minNumOfConsistentCams</i> to 2 and 
                    <i>minNumOfConsistentCamsWithLowSimilarity</i> to 3, under <i>DepthMapFilter_1</i>. Additionally, to fit the job within the time constraints of the Peanut Cluster, parameter <i>describerPreset</i>
                    was set to "low" under <i>FeatureExtraction_1</i>. This reduced accuracy but improved computation time.
